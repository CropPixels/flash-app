# Flash App

A basic flashcard App written in Javascript and HTML. 

This is a basic web app I created with the aid of a few different LLMs, mostly qwen2.5-coder. 
I also tried phi4 and ChatGPT but I didn't like the output of those as much.

To run, clone the repo and run "node index.js" to serve into your browser at http://localhost:3000
